# Customer_Segmentatoin_KMeans
The KMeans algorithm clusters data by trying to separate samples in n groups of equal variance, minimizing a criterion known as the inertia or within-cluster sum-of-squares (see below). This algorithm requires the number of clusters to be specified. It scales well to large number of samples and has been used across a large range of application areas in many different fields.

The k-means algorithm divides a set of  samples  into  disjoint clusters , each described by the mean 
 of the samples in the cluster. The means are commonly called the cluster “centroids”; note that they are not, in general, points from , although they live in the same space.

The K-means algorithm aims to choose centroids that minimise the inertia, or within-cluster sum-of-squares criterion.

 
Here's my simple code on how to actually apply clustering on a basic dataset.
